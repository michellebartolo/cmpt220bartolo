//Michelle Bartolo- Lab 3- Problem 5.7- 2/22/17

//**5.7 (Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. 
//In one year, the tuition will be $10,500. Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition
//after the tenth year.
